A simple approach towards making a bot. To contribute:
  1. Install Node in your system
  2. Git pull the repo: https://github.com/bikos/bidhutiyeKira.git
  3. Open the project in your editor and update your API keys from Binance on config.json
  4. CD to bidhutiyeKira in your terminal and run "node server.js"
  5. This will create a webserver listening to port 3000, open your browser and navigate to localhost:3000
  6. Take a tour around, if you feel like you can make this better, commit your changes with pull requests.
